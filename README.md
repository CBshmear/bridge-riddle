## Description
Finding the motivation for studying can be hard. To solve that I wanted to create a simple multiple choice quiz that scores you based on time to completion and subtracts time when you get a question wrong. Through this, I have learned alot about DOM manipulation with JavaScript. Unfortunately I didnt learn quite enough. I had the script all written and it functioned fine albeit messily. I attempted a rewrite and did not make my deadline!
